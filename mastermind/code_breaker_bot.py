Hello!
I am the Code Breaker. I am excited to be playing against you today!

First I'll explain the rules:

You have pegs in multiple colours and spots to place them on.
You can use the same colour on multiple spots, and the order matters!
You can choose from the following colours:
    - red (r)
    - blue (b)
    - green (g)
    - yellow (y)
    - purple (p)
    - orange (o)

When you have created the combination, I will attempt to guess it.
After I guess, please provide me with feedback!

Give me a red pin for every peg that is the correct colour and in the correct spot.
Give a white pin for every peg that is the the correct colour, but not in the correct spot.

Every peg in your code can only award one pin. Red feedback_pins have priority over white feedback_pins.
(e.g. if your code is:   Blue,   Blue,   Green,  Green
and I guess:             Blue,   Green,  Green,  Green,
I will receive two red feedback_pins and no white ones.
The second peg in my guess (green) will not receive a white peg, because both green pegs
in your code already awarded a pin.)


Those are the rules!
If you are confused about anything, please look up the official mastermind rules at
https://www.ultraboardgames.com/mastermind/game-rules.php


Please create a secret code!
Remember it well, or write it down somewhere.
